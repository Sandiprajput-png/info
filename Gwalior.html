       <b> Gwalior Fort: A Gem in Madhya Pradesh</b><br>
       If you go by local legends, this majestic fort was constructed in 3rd CE, and was the brainchild of the then ruling emperor Raja Suraj Sen Pal. According to the same legend, the name of the fort was coined in honour of the sage ‘Gwalipa’ who helped cure the king’s leprosy affliction.

The interesting story of Gwalior Fort does not end here. Did you know that this is one of the most historic forts in Northern and Central India? It was not only ruled by the family of Suraj Sen, who was probably a Kachchhapaghata, but changed hands many times throughout history. Some historical accounts confirm that during the 16th century, the family lost possession of this fort and it was acquired by the Mughals and later by Marathas for a certain period.

Further, during the British regime, it was established as the Gwalior Kingdom which was earlier a province of the large Maratha empire. After independence, the Central Government took possession of this fort and has been taking care of it ever since.

The popularity of this fort had reached such heights around 1022 CE, that it was attacked for four consecutive days by Mahmud of Ghazni. Several other Mughal rulers fought wars to establish their hold over this mighty beauty!

 Gwalior Fort: Today
 Presently, the fort is open to anyone who wishes to be transported back in time to bask in the grandeur of medieval artefacts and impressive architectural designs. Due to its rich and intriguing history, there is a popular light and sound show organised here every evening. It is conducted at Man Mandir and offers tourists a fabulous opportunity to delve into some of the biggest events in history.

 Gwalior Fort: Architecture
This grand Gwalior Fort sprawls over an area of nearly 3 sq. km. Its height is more than 10 m. The iconic fort built on a hilltop offers a spectacular 360-degree view of the landscape around it. You will also catch glimpses of massive water tanks that were specifically designed to store water for weeks and months.

The magnificent structure is mainly constructed with sandstones. However, the numerous temples and palaces built inside exhibit other materials as well. One of the most famous architectural gems you wouldn’t want to miss is the Teli ka Mandir, which is completely built in the ancient Dravidian style and is beautifully sculpted.
