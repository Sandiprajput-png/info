Between May and August, a selection of mountain flowers is in their full blossom. The rhododendrons, different species of primulas, blue and yellow poppies and irises make an uprising of colours around the lake. The area around the lake is the perfect habitation for the red panda and a variety of species of birds. The lake also offers residence to brahminy ducks.
