        <b>Baihata Chariali</b><br>
        Madan Kamdev (Pron: ˈmʌdən/məˈdɑ:n kæmˈdeɪv/ˈkʌmˌdeɪv) is an archaeological site in Baihata Chariali, Kamrup, Assam. The place dates back to the 9th and 10th century A.D. The excavation and ruins is dated back to the Pala dynasty of Kamarupa.
        The ruins are believed to be the remains of more than 20 temples consigned to Lord Shiva. The surviving portion of Madan Kamdev shows that these were perhaps the finest mediaval temples ever built in the entire Brahmaputra Valley. Be it so, or it otherwise Madan Kamdev, continues to remain an archeological challenge.
        <br><b>the Madan Kamdev temple complex</b><br>
        These are the ruins of the Madan Kamdev temple complex, whose erotic iconography has given it the nickname 'Khajuraho of Assam'. Further underlining its erotic nature is the ruined garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) of a medieval temple.
        
        Analysis of the temples and the idols engraved on the walls, led the Archeological Survey to conclude these temples were constructed during from the 10th to the 12th centuries. The Kamarupa kings of Pala dynasty, namely Ratna Pala, Indra Pala and Go Pala, ordered construction of these temples.
