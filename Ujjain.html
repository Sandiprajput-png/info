       <b> Mahakaleshwar</b><br> 
        Jyotirlinga is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, shrines which are said to be the most sacred abodes of Shiva. It is located in the ancient city of Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The temple is situated on the side of the holy river Shipra
        The history of Mahakaleshwar Temple Ujjain is very interesting & engrossing. It is believed that, long ago, the city of Ujjain was ruled by King Chandrasen. The king was an avid devotee of Lord Shiva. A young fellow – Shrikhar – was highly motivated by his devotion and desired to be a part of his prayers. Unfortunately, he was rejected by royal cavalry.

Incidentally, some neighbouring rulers were planning then to attack Ujjain. Shrikhar and the local priest – Vridhi – heard about it and started praying relentlessly. Lord Shiva heard their prayers and decided to forever safeguard this city as a lingam. Thereafter, the ruling king and his successors raised the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga Temple.

The Ujjain Mahakal Temple suffered many attacks over time and was destroyed & demolished. However, the Scindia clan took over the responsibility of its restoration in the 19th century.
